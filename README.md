Star Students began as a game that was requested by CBS De Schutse -  a school with a unique teaching style. Besides conventional learning methods it deploys a self-developed talent system that allows students to pursue their passions by identifying with a certain archetype and developing it as they work in groups with other children.

In order to enhance their teaching experience, CBS De Schutse contacted us to make a digital tool that would allow the students to take a more playful approach to discovering what they are good at while working with others. 

Eventually, the game grew beyond its original intended use as we began exploring the idea of changing the product from a custom-made one to one available on the general market. We have continued to work with CBS De Schutse for testing purposes.
